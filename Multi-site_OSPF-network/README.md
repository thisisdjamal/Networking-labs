# Multi-site OSPF Network

## Overview

This project implements a multi-site enterprise network connecting a **Headquarters (Agency A)** and a **Branch Office (Agency B)** through a dedicated inter-site backbone with redundant Internet edges in a simulated environment.

Agency A implements a **fully redundant three-tier network architecture** composed of Core, Distribution, and Access layers to maximize availability and minimize single points of failure. Agency B uses a **collapsed-core architecture**, combining core and distribution functions to provide a more cost-effective design suitable for a smaller site.

Internal departmental networks are segmented using dedicated **VLANs**, with each VLAN assigned a `/27` IPv4 subnet from the `172.16.0.0/16` private address space. Public-facing services, including **HTTPS and DNS servers**, are isolated within a dedicated **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)** to limit the exposure of internal resources.

Point-to-point routed links use `/30` subnets from the `10.0.0.0/8` private address space, while simulated Internet-facing links use public IPv4 addressing.

The routing architecture relies primarily on **OSPF** for dynamic internal routing, while **BGP** is used at the Internet edge to simulate external routing.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this architecture are:

* **High Availability:** Provide network redundancy at the headquarters through dual-homed distribution switches, redundant paths, HSRP, and link aggregation.
* **Perimeter Security:** Isolate public-facing services within a dedicated DMZ and control traffic between security zones using a Zone-Based Firewall.
* **Network Segmentation:** Separate departmental traffic into dedicated VLANs to reduce broadcast domains and improve traffic isolation.
* **Dynamic Routing:** Use OSPF to automatically exchange internal routes and provide dynamic path selection across the multi-site infrastructure.
* **Internet Edge Redundancy:** Simulate redundant Internet connectivity using two edge routers and BGP.
* **Cost-Optimized Scalability:** Deploy a full three-tier architecture at the headquarters while using a collapsed-core model at the branch to reduce infrastructure complexity and hardware requirements.
* **Efficient IPv4 Allocation:** Apply VLSM to allocate `/27` subnets to departmental networks and `/30` subnets to point-to-point transit links, minimizing IPv4 address waste.

## Technologies

The architecture uses the following networking technologies and protocols:

* **VLAN** : Logical segmentation of the Layer 2 network into separate broadcast domains.
* **IPv4 & VLSM** : Structured and efficient IPv4 address allocation.
* **Inter-VLAN Routing** : Layer 3 communication between departmental VLANs.
* **DHCP** : Automatic assignment of IP configuration to end devices.
* **OSPF** : Dynamic Interior Gateway Protocol used for routing within the enterprise network.
* **HSRP** : First-hop redundancy protocol providing a highly available default gateway.
* **LACP** : Link Aggregation Control Protocol used to combine multiple physical links into a logical link.
* **BGP** : Exterior Gateway Protocol used to simulate routing between the enterprise network and external networks.
* **Zone-Based Firewall** : Stateful traffic filtering between defined security zones.
* **NAT** : Translation between private and public IPv4 address spaces.
* **Layer 3 Routing** : IP-based forwarding between sites, VLANs, and network segments.


### Agency A : Headquarters

Agency A uses a **three-tier hierarchical architecture**:

* **Core Layer:** Provides high-speed Layer 3 connectivity and redundant paths between major network segments.
* **Distribution Layer:** Aggregates access switches, provides inter-VLAN routing, implements redundancy, and applies network policies.
* **Access Layer:** Connects end-user devices and provides VLAN-based segmentation.

Redundant uplinks between the distribution and access layers improve resilience and provide alternative forwarding paths in case of link or device failure.

### Agency B : Branch Office

Agency B uses a **collapsed-core architecture**, where core and distribution functions are consolidated.

This approach reduces the number of required network devices while maintaining Layer 3 routing, VLAN segmentation, and connectivity with the headquarters.

### Inter-Site Connectivity

Agency A and Agency B are interconnected through a routed backbone.

OSPF dynamically exchanges internal routes between the sites, allowing traffic to use available paths without relying exclusively on static routes.

### Internet Edge and DMZ

The Internet edge provides connectivity between the enterprise network and simulated external networks.

Public-facing services are placed in a dedicated DMZ rather than directly inside the internal network. NAT and firewall policies control the communication between the Internet, DMZ, and internal networks.

## Future Improvements

The architecture could be further developed by introducing:

* **Migration to a virtualized or emulated environment**, such as EVE-NG or GNS3, to validate behavior closer to real Cisco IOS/IOS-XE environments.
* **Enhanced network monitoring and observability** using SNMP, Syslog
* **Implementation of a defense-in-depth security architecture** by deploying a next-generation firewall such as FortiGate right after the edge routers to  strengthen security and provide intrusion prevention
* **IPv6 deployment** alongside IPv4 to support dual-stack operation 
* **High-availability improvements** 
* **Centralized configuration and backup management** to improve operational reliability and simplify recovery.
